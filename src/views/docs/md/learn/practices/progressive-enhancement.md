title: Progressive enhancement
---

## Prototype to production
The enhance ethos is to build your app incrementally. Start with working HTML, break out Custom Elements as the need for reuse arises, create apis that return hard-coded data, add database storage and retrieval to your apis, then layer on user interactions in the browser. Progressively enhancing your application from working prototype to production ready product with the same codebase.

## Solid foundation
Custom Elements are a solid foundation for progressive enhancement. Knowing you have correct, accessible, semantic markup with working forms before adding on the user interactions that require JavaScript means your application will work everywhere the web does. Your users will be able to use your site even when unforeseen circumstances like a rouge third-party script or a bad connection interfere.

## Just what's needed
Progressively enhancing Custom Elements ensures that you are only adding the JavaScript necessary for your user interactions. No need to back every element with JavaScript, just what you need to update based off of user interactions and data changes.

## Dependency free
The platform supplies everything you need to progressively enhance a Custom Element, it's all built into the browser. No longer do you need to load megabytes of JavaScript to render one button. It is possible to build an entire app with just what ships in the browser.

Here is what it would take to progressively enhance a `my-message` element.

Author this HTML
```html
<my-message message="Progressive"></my-message>
```

Create this single file component
```html
export default function MyMessage({ html, state }) {
  const { attrs } = state
  const { message='' } = attrs
  return html`
<h1>${ message }</h1>

<script type="module">
class MyMessage extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super()
    this.heading = this.querySelector('h1')
  }

  static get observedAttributes() {
    return [ 'message' ]
  }

  attributeChangedCallback(name, oldValue, newValue) {
    if (oldValue !== newValue) {
      if (name === 'message') {
        this.heading.textContent = newValue
      }
    }
  }
}
customElements.define('my-message', MyMessage)
</script>
`
}
```
With scoped DOM queries and low level DOM apis you can perform optimal surgical updates to your element.

†You would need to add a template to this class in order to expand the `<my-message>` tag when dynamically added to the document via JavaScript. [See this version →](https://gist.github.com/kristoferjoseph/dd5d22018a0f7feedd4ee18f25a040a8)

## Externalize scripts
If your script outgrows your single file component you can link to it. Another way you can incrementally progress your elements to support your needs.

Move your script to the `/public` folder
```html
Create this single file component
```html
export default function MyMessage({ html, state }) {
  const { attrs } = state
  const { message='' } = attrs
  return html`
<h1>${ message }</h1>
<script type="module" src="/_static/my-message.mjs"></script>
`
}

```

## Just a spoonful
Adding minimal sugar to the syntax starts to look more familiar to users coming from other non-standards based front-end frameworks. The trade-off is losing the power of optimized DOM updates, but you can always start with what you are comfortable with and eject to the platform if the need for optimal performance arises.

```javascript
import enhance from '@enhance/enhance'
enhance(
  'my-message',
  {
    attrs: [ 'message' ],
    init(el) {
      el.heading = el.querySelector('h1')
    },
    render({ html, state }) {
      const { attrs } = state
      const { message } = attrs
      return html`
      <h1>${ message }</h1>
      `
    }
  }
)
```

## Many choices
Starting with working HTML doesn't limit how you add user interactions to your front-end. You could progressively enhance your elements in a number of ways. Working with the platform gives you many paths to success.
