## General styling
[†](#footnote)Utility classes are an optimal way to apply general styling. They remove large amounts of duplication from your stylesheets and lend visual harmony to your sites.

## Styleguide
As a basis of styleguides utility classes are unparalleled in providing a usable system for developers and a cohesive appearance to your users.

## Ready to go
Enhance comes preconfigured with a [customizable utility class system](#). During development you can use the stylesheet found in `public/styles.css`. For production you can inline this stylesheet into the head of your document since utility class stylesheets tend to be tiny — around ~30k on disk and 9k over the wire.
