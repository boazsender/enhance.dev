title: Pages

Pages are the entry point for enhance rendering. They can be written in standard HTML and the output is setup for progressive enhancement with custom elements in the browser. Pages live in the `app/pages/` folder of the enhance starter project.

## File based routing

Pages in the enhance starter project enable file based routing, so adding a `app/pages/about.html` for instance will make it available at `/about` in your browser.

## HTML by default

Pages are written in HTML and can be composed of many dynamic custom elements. Pages are meant to be rendered once server-side.

## Dynamic if need be

If you decide that you absolutely need to handle state in your page element then you have the ability to turn it into a single file component as well.

You'll find that working this way will allow you to start with working HTML then incrementally create custom element components as the need for reuse arises.
