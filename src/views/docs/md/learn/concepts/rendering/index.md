Templates are pure functions that return an HTML string. Pure functions mean that given the same input the function will return the same output every time.

## Setup

Enhance passes an object to every template that contains an html render function in order to expand custom elements and a state object that contains the attributes from the element and a data store that you populate with initial state.

Setup your render function by passing an elements collection and optional initial state.
```javascript
import enhance from '@enhance/ssr'

const html = enhance({
  elements: {
    'my-element': function MyElement({ html, state }) {
      const { store } = state
      const message = store?.message || 'Nothing'
      return html`<h1>${ message }</h1>`
    }
  },
  initialState: { message: 'ðŸŽ¶This is how we do it' }
})

const output = html`
<head>
  <title>My Element test</title>
</head>
<my-element></my-element>
`
console.log('OUTPUT: ', output)
```

> ðŸ‘† You can supply your own head tag and contents

## Initial render

Templates are rendered on the server and do the tedious parts of setting up your component for the browser.
Enhance will add a `<template>` tag to the resulting HTML document with an id corresponding to your custom element name as well as moving any script tags in your component to the bottom of the document. Enhance will also add a template for any slotted content you author.

### Enhanced output

Here is what the output of our initial render looks like:
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Element test</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <my-element>
      <h1>ðŸŽ¶This is how we do it</h1>
    </my-element>
    <template id="my-element-template">
      <h1>ðŸŽ¶This is how we do it</h1>
    </template>
 </body>
</html>
```
