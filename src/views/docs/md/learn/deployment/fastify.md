Fastify is a very fast, beautifully designed, and well maintained app server for Node. `@enhance/fastify-plugin` gives you the ability to build your frontend completely in HTML, and pure custom elements. 

Fastify can be deployed to any cloud vendor that supports deploying a Node web server; the most popular choices are AWS, Azure, and GCP.
